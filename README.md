# detecting_gingivitis_AI
This project leverages AI and image processing techniques to detect gingivitis from gum images. It involves preprocessing, feature extraction (color, texture, and redness intensity), and classification using machine learning models. The system aims to assist early detection, improving dental healthcare efficiency.
